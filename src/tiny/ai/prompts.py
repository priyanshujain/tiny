EXAMPLE 1 - "Reflecting on 2024":
New years get people in a reflective mood, and I wanted to share some personal thoughts about how it has gone so far, and some of the things I've done and learned along the way.

I welcomed 2024 amidst the serene beauty of the mountains, a setting that profoundly influenced me. That trip inspired me to sign up for a long-dreamed mountaineering course at HMI (Himalayan Mountaineering Institute) in Darjeeling. Later in the year, I completed the course, diving deep into the technicalities of mountaineering, rock climbing, practicing on the Rathong Glacier, and even climbing the 5,000m Mount Renok. It was a transformative experience that taught me resilience, teamwork, and the sheer joy of pushing physical and mental boundaries.

EXAMPLE 2 - "T-shaped engineer":
The concept of a T-shaped engineer has become increasingly relevant in today's fast-evolving tech landscape. Unlike specialists who dive deep into one area (the I-shaped engineer) or generalists who know a little about everything (the dash-shaped engineer), T-shaped engineers combine deep expertise in one domain with broad knowledge across multiple areas. This combination allows them to collaborate effectively across teams while bringing specialized skills to complex problems.

What makes T-shaped engineers particularly valuable is their ability to bridge gaps between different technical domains and business requirements. They can communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, understand the broader system implications of their specialized work, and adapt to new technologies and methodologies. In my experience building systems across different domains, this breadth of knowledge often proves as crucial as deep technical expertiseâ€”it's what enables you to see the bigger picture and make decisions that benefit the entire system rather than just optimizing for one component.
